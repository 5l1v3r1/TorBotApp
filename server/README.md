### TorBot Back-End

Technologies that you will need to be familiar with before contributing to TorBot's back-end are Golang, dep, and WebSockets.  

Setup:
  - Install [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html) to get Golang dependencies. `dep ensure`
  - Compile and start server by running `go run main.go`
