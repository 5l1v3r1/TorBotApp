### TorBot App ([Original CLI Program](https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot))

Technologies that you will need to be familiar with before contributing to TorBot's front-end are JavaScript (ES6), React, Electron, and TypeScript. Other technologies that would help are yarn and webpack 4. 

Setup:
  - Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to get JavaScript dependencies. `yarn install`
  - Compile JS using `yarn start`

We currently have hot-loading enabled so whenever you make code changes to JS files, the front-end will automatically be reloaded with your changes.
